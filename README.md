# Doodle Guesser
Welcome! This is a doodle guessing game! I wonder if the computer can guess what you are drawing? Are you a good artist?

The underlying model is a custom PyTorch CNN model that is trained on handdrawn doodles. The training data is limited due to it all being handdrawn! So most objects you can draw will not be in the database, although it will try its best to recognize them!

If you can help submit data, I'd recommend following the steps below:

1. Think of what class/doodle you'd like to draw!
2. Create a folder named after the object.
3. Go on MS Paint, or Pinta (for Linux) or any other drawing application and start a white 100 x 100 image!
4. Make a super simple drawing of your object using only a black paintbrush
5. Save
6. Repeat Steps 4 & 5 ~ 30-60 times
7. Send them to me! (alexanderwang@ufl.edu)
